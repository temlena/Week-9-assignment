##Javascript array methods
Mutating array methods modify the original array directly. E.g: push(), pop(), splice(), sort(), reverse(),unshift(),shift().
Non-mutating array methods do not modify the original array but instead return a new array. E.g: slice(),concat(), filter(),reduce(), map().
###Javascript Functions
A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a specific task. It is executed when invoked or called.It is defined with the function keyword, followed by a name, and parentheses (), parameters are also listed inside the parentheses i.e function name(parameters). Function names can include letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs. Code to be executed is enclosed in curly brackets {}.
Functions can be used as variables in like variables in formulas, assignment and calculations.
Functions in JavaScript are first-class objects, enabling them to be passed, returned, and assigned like other objects.
Functions use parameters (in declaration) and arguments (in invocation). Arguments are passed by value. Functions return a value; if not specified, it defaults to undefined.
JavaScript has regular functions, generator functions, async functions, and async generator functions.
The purpose of Functions is for writing code that can be used multiple times.We can use the same code with different arguments to produce different results with function.

###Control flow statement
Control flow statements are used to control the order in which statements are executed in a program, based on certain conditions or criteria.
If/Else Statements: Execute code based on a true or false condition.
Switch Statements: Execute code based on the value of a variable.
Loops: Execute a block of code multiple times, based on a certain condition. There are two main types of loops in JavaScript: for loops and while loops.
While and Do…While Loops: The while loop executes a specified statement as long as the test condition evaluates to true. The do…while loop will first execute the code, then continue while the condition remains true.
JavaScript conditionals handle multiple conditions using logical operators like &&, ||, and !. == performs type conversion, while === checks strict equality without type conversion. Loops can be stopped using the break statement, while continue skips the current iteration.
